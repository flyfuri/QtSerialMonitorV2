This is a fork of [QtSerialMonitor](https://github.com/mich-w/QtSerialMonitor). All credit goes to Michal.

I am using it to practice Qt and create an interface to my project [CondorRudderPedal_ESP8622](https://github.com/flyfuri/CondorRudderPedal_ESP8622).

I just ported it to Qt6 and will add some futures. If something useful results, I'll either push-request them to Michal or fully document this Version/Repo.

Stay tuned...

### What is already useful:
If you want to know what it does and/or are looking for the original source code for Qt5 got to the original [QtSerialMonitor](https://github.com/mich-w/QtSerialMonitor).

Otherwise one of the following branches could be used (all Qt6):

|branch |description|status|
|-------|------------------|--------------------------|
|"Qt6"| same as the original but for Qt6|seems to work (only tested with Serial)|
|"CustomBaudDialog"| improved GUI for custom baudrate |seems to work (only tested with Serial)|

branch main contains all the latest changes with status "seems to work"
